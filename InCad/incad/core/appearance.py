"""Appearance (the user: "rendering of parts, or at least colour"; "Hide Edges"): a Solid's colour and finish, faces
of it in their own colour and finish, its edges shown or hidden. Kept on the Solid itself (a hidden App property, so
it is saved with the file and every change is one undo step) and drawn through its view's ShapeAppearance — one
material per face. A face is remembered by where it is (its centre and area), not by its number: a feature added
or changed renumbers the faces, and the colour is found again on the face that is still there."""
