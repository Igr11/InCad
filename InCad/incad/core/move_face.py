"""Move Face: flat faces moved along their normal by d (outward > 0) — the slab between the faces' old and new place is
added (d > 0) or cut (d < 0). Three ways for the neighbours (the faces sharing an edge with a moved face):
- step: the slab is the face pushed straight (a slanted neighbour stays, a straight wall appears at its edge);
- inventor: the slab's side walls lie on the neighbours (flat at any angle, or a cylinder along the move), so a chamfer
  keeps its angle and grows / shrinks; a round neighbour across the move cannot follow yet;
- together: the face moves with its neighbours that are not along the move (chamfers, fillets) as one piece; the walls
  around them must run along the move and grow.
Faces are kept by geometry (signature / find), never by name. Pure Part code, headless."""
