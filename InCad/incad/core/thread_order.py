"""A cut or join through a modeled (helical) thread breaks in FreeCAD's kernel: OpenCASCADE gives an invalid shape
for a cut, and a join keeps only the new piece (the part vanished: the user's slot revolved over a tapped Hole,
p2_test). The same boolean before the thread works. So such a feature goes into the tree right before the thread by
itself (the user's choice), its profile sketch and helpers with it, attached to the same face of the part as it is
there; the thread is made after it and cuts its result. A projected edge that only exists with the thread (the
hole's rim, a face of the thread's chamfer) is let go: FreeCAD can't point it elsewhere, and the sketch keeps its
lines where they are."""
