"""Split by sketch: each line of a sketch (segment, arc, spline) is extruded along the sketch's normal, both ways,
through the whole part into a surface of zero thickness; these knives divide the shape before this step.
Keep all (Inventor's Split Solid): this Solid keeps the largest piece and every other piece becomes a Solid of its own
(a body on a SplitPiece that follows the Split), so each can be hidden, worked on and made a part of its own.
Keep picked: only the pieces at the stored points (a spot picked on each) stay, the nearest piece to each point on
every recompute.

loses its material within its share of the gap from the cut lines — Both: half from every piece; This Solid: all of
