"""Mirror Solid (Inventor's Mirror ▸ Solid, New solid): a mirrored copy of a whole Solid, as a Solid of its own,
that follows its original — every change to the original, features added to it later, shows in the copy on the next
recompute — until Break Mirror Link (right-click its row) keeps the copy as it is (the user: "the exact way as in
the sketch"). The copy is the first step of its new Solid (a PartDesign::FeaturePython marked InCadMirrorSolid), so
its row sits in the part's history and features can be added on it. Result Join / Cut instead mirrors the Solid
into itself (a half made whole, a shape cut by its mirror image): a step at the end of that Solid that mirrors what
comes before it.

Break Mirror Link on a feature Mirror (PartDesign::Mirrored) keeps the material it added and removed as it is
now (a step of its own in its place); the features before it still change the part under it."""
